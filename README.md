# React Shapebase
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-shapebase.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-shapebase)

**React Shapebase is a set of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components that are based on the fundamentals of shapes and basic geometry**. The library is inspired by [Atomic-Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [Googles Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/). The library will harmoniously integrate with your webpack workflow, although you can use any other module bundler.

**Note:**  ‚ö†Ô∏è This source code is currently experimental and in a very early alpha phase.

## Quickstart üèÉ‚Äç
First, make sure you have installed a recent [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version.

Then in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeddyAndersson/react-shapebase.git
cd react-shapebase && npm install
```

To work in the project, you need a `node` version that supports ES6 syntax. Although the project is built using Babel we use some ES6 features in the development server. Consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to handle different node versions!

The project is being initially developed and maintained by [Teddy Andersson](https://github.com/TeddyAndersson) and the [contribution scene](https://github.com/TeddyAndersson/react-shapebase/graphs/contributors) is open for anyone with an interest for the project to join. I want to create reference components, so any contribution is very welcome.
